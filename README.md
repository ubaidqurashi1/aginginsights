# Information Thermodynamics of Aging

This repository contains the computational framework and synthetic validation for the theoretical framework "Aging as an Information Thermodynamics Problem".

## Overview

This work presents a mathematical framework demonstrating that biological aging is fundamentally governed by the irreversible degradation of regulatory information in open, non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems. The framework is validated using synthetic data simulations that demonstrate:

- Information loss precedes molecular damage accumulation
- Granger causality between information metrics and damage markers
- Intervention responses to information restoration
